# Tests for bin/fm-update.sh: fast-forward-only self-update of a running
# firstmate repo and every registered secondmate home.
#
# The guarantees under test mirror fm-fleet-sync.sh and prime directive #3:
#   - The running firstmate repo and each secondmate home fast-forward from
#     upstream when configured, otherwise origin.
#   - FAST-FORWARD ONLY: a dirty, diverged, offline, or wrong-branch target is
#     skipped and reported, never forced or stashed, so unlanded work survives.
#   - The update is a single-parent fast-forward (never a merge commit) and a
#     fast-forward of one worktree never disturbs another worktree's checkout
#     or the shared default branch.
#   - The caller-action summary is correct: reread-firstmate flips to yes only
#     when the instruction surface (AGENTS.md / bin / .agents/skills) changed, and
#     nudge-secondmates lists exactly the live secondmates that advanced.
#   - Secondmate homes resolve from both state/<id>.meta and the
#     data/secondmates.md registry, deduped, and the firstmate repo is never
#     re-processed as one of its own secondmates.
